    <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">
       ServiceNow Developer with 3+ years of experience in designing, developing, and automating workflows in ServiceNow. Strong expertise in ITSM, integrations, scripting (JavaScript, Glide API), and UI customizations. Experienced in Agile environments and passionate about optimizing IT operations through automation.
         I worked at TCS for 3 Years, involving projects <strong>ServiceNow</strong>and <strong>SharePoint</strong>. These projects are extensively on ServiceNow development, where I customized and created tables, designed optimized forms, and implemented automated workflows using Flow Designer. I developed custom approval processes, REST API integrations, and role-based access controls (RBAC) to streamline IT operations and enhance system efficiency. Additionally, I contributed to ITSM workflow enhancements, reducing manual intervention and improving request resolution times. I also earned a 
        <strong>Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering</strong> from <strong>JNTUK Unviversity</strong> and, I hold a <strong>Graduate Certificate in Embedded Systems Development</strong> from <strong>Conestoga College</strong>
        I am passionate about leveraging ServiceNow to streamline business processes, enhance IT service management, and drive automation through scalable and efficient workflows.
